# Artificial Intelligence Merit Badge — 2-Hour Curriculum Outline

## 0:00–0:10 — Introduction & Overview
- Welcome, introductions, and session goals.
- Briefly explain what AI is and why it matters.

## 0:10–0:30 — Key Concepts (Requirement 1)
- Define key terms: AI, agents, automation, programming, bots, data, databases, digital workers, general AI, ML, narrow AI, superintelligent AI, tasks, triggers, workflows, variables.
- Use slides or a handout for definitions.
- Quick group Q&A to reinforce understanding.

## 0:30–0:50 — AI & Automation in Daily Life (Requirements 2a–c, 3a–c)
- Discuss and brainstorm examples of AI and automation in everyday life, workplace, and school.
- Use interactive polling or group discussion.
- Show short video clips or live demos (e.g., voice assistants, chatbots, smart devices).

## 0:50–1:00 — Timelines (Requirements 2e, 3e)
- Present a visual timeline of AI and automation milestones.
- Highlight 5 key events for each.
- Use a timeline slide or poster.

## 1:00–1:15 — Ethics in AI (Requirement 4a, 4c, 4d)
- Discuss ethical concerns: bias, privacy, decision-making.
- Explain the Turing Test.
- Group brainstorm: What guidelines should we have for AI use?

## 1:15–1:25 — Deepfakes (Requirement 5a, 5b)
- Explain what deepfakes are and their impact.
- Show a short, safe example video.
- Discuss what to do if affected.

## 1:25–1:35 — Communicating with AI (Requirement 6a–c)
- Discuss how AI learns and its limitations.
- Demonstrate prompt engineering and clear instructions.
- Show 2–3 live examples (e.g., using ChatGPT or Google Bard).

## 1:35–1:45 — Practical Application (Requirement 6d, 7)
- Demonstrate writing clear instructions for a school task.
- Discuss project or lesson plan options (Requirement 7).
- **Note:** Full project/lesson plan implementation is not feasible in 2 hours.

## 1:45–1:55 — Career Exploration (Requirement 8)
- Discuss 3 AI/automation careers.
- Share training, education, and job outlook.
- **Note:** In-depth research or interviews are not feasible in 2 hours.

## 1:55–2:00 — Wrap-up & Next Steps
- Review what was covered.
- Discuss what scouts need to complete outside the session.
- Q&A and counselor sign-off process.

---

## Requirements Not Feasible to Fully Complete in 2 Hours
- **2d:** Play 10 rounds of "AI or Not?" with counselor.
- **4b:** Play and discuss 5 rounds of "What Would You Do?" ethical scenarios.
- **7:** Complete a full AI project or teach a lesson plan.
- **8:** Complete in-depth career research or conduct a professional interview.

These can be introduced, but scouts will need to finish them outside the session.

## Presentation & Engagement Strategies

### Visuals & Interactivity
- Use slides for definitions, timelines, and key concepts.
- Use live demos (e.g., ChatGPT, Google Assistant, image generators).
- Show short, relevant video clips (deepfakes, AI in action).
- Use polling tools (Kahoot, Mentimeter) for interactive quizzes.

### Working Examples
- Live demo: Ask an AI chatbot to answer a question or write a story.
- Show a simple automation (e.g., IFTTT or Zapier workflow).
- Demonstrate prompt engineering: show how different prompts yield different AI responses.

### App/Tool Recommendations

#### Next.js App
- A Next.js app could be very effective for:
  - Interactive timelines (AI/automation history).
  - "AI or Not?" and "What Would You Do?" games.
  - Visualizing key concepts and examples.
  - Collecting responses from scouts in real time.

#### Alternatives
- Google Slides or PowerPoint for a simple, visual presentation.
- Kahoot or Mentimeter for interactive quizzes.
- Jupyter Notebook for live coding demos (if you want to show code).

## Recommendation

Given the need for strong visuals, interactivity, and the ability to run simple games or demos, a Next.js app is an excellent choice. It can:
- Step through the curriculum visually.
- Run interactive games (e.g., "AI or Not?").
- Show timelines and definitions.
- Collect scout responses for group activities.

If you’d like, I can scaffold a Next.js app tailored for this curriculum, with pages for each section, interactive games, and visual timelines. Let me know if you want to proceed with this, or if you prefer a simpler slide-based approach!
