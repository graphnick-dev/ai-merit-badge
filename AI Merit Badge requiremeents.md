# Artificial Intelligence Merit Badge Overview

The Artificial Intelligence (AI) Merit Badge introduces Scouts to the fundamentals of AI and automation through hands-on activities and real-world examples. Scouts learn key terms, explore how AI and automation are used in daily life, school, and work, and examine ethical concerns like bias and privacy. They also investigate deepfakes, practice communicating effectively with AI, and apply their knowledge through a project or teaching activity. Finally, Scouts explore career paths in AI by researching or interviewing professionals in the field.

## Artificial Intelligence Merit Badge Requirements

> The previous version of the Merit Badge requirements can be found in Scoutbook

> **NOTE TO SCOUTS:** The Artificial Intelligence (AI) merit badge has no merit badge pamphlet. Instead, it has been designed for you to interact with the Scoutly chatbot on your learning journey as you work through the requirements. Scoutly can be found on the bottom right of your browser at [https://scouting.org](https://scouting.org). If you have a question about a requirement, ask Scoutly! Hint: try asking Scoutly to Explain the "xxx" activity for requirement "yy" of the AI merit badge. This does not replace the requirement to identify and work with a counselor to complete the badge. Additional educational resources are available on our Counselor Information Page.
